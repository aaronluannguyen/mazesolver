# CSE Maze Solver Project
Project that where we implemented Kruskal's and Dijkstra's algorithm to generate and solve mazes
- Implemented an ArrayDisjointSet class using array-based representation
- Implemented a Graph's constructor
- Implemented a findMinimumSpanningTree method using Kruskal's algorithm
- Implemented a KruskalMazeCarver method which generated random mazes by removing random walls while ensuring the maze is still solvable
- Implemented a findShortestPathBetween method that used Dijkstra's algorithm to solve for the shortest path to solve a given maze
